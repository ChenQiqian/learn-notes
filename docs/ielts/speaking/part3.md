思路：

用几个固定的话题去应付所有的问题

## 思路一：压力

现状 --> 导致 --> 解决

### 现状

face greater pressure from

+ expensive housing & heavy living cost
+ fierce competition
+ busy life pace

### 导致

+ push them to work hard
+ have no time to entertainment
+ often under depression, easy to get angry and sad

### 解决

+ share our pressure with other
+ release pressure by playing computer games, listening to music, traveling, reading, so on


## 思路二：金钱

something is expensive, some behaviour is exclusive

---> making money is difficult, the unemployment is rocketing these days

---> people will cherish it / people won't do this unless necessary

## 思路三：方便

## 思路四：健康

## 思路五：独立

## 思路六：社交
