# Part1 Short question

## Work/Study

???question "What is your major?"
    My major[ˈmeɪdʒə] is Software Engineering. 
    
    Software Engineering is quite similar to Computer Science, because we all learn things that happen in computer. 

    However, as the name "Engineering", we emphasize the ability to build complex and reliable software systems.

???question "What is the most interesting thing about the subject / major?[Why?]"
    Personally, I think the most interesting thing about the Software Engineering is that,
    
    almost everything we encounter in this world can be solved or just simplified by programming.

    The reason why I think it's interesting is because it makes me feel that I'm really powerful, and using the skills I learned, I can overcome most of the difficulties.

???question "What can you do in the future with your degree?[Why?]"
    Well, what to do in future with my degree was the question that I'm always thinking about. 
    
    The most popular choice would be to go to the Big IT Company and be a programmer, which is very well-paid. 

    However, I prefer going to University as a teacher, because I really to spread my knowledge to more young people. 

???question "How do you usually spend your day when you're studying?"
    I usually study with my friend, in library, classroom or even video meeting room.

    We can communicate when there are difficult questions, and chat with each other if we want to relax ourselves.

    This is pretty effective ways to motivate myself and maintain in a good mood.

    By the way, in the past month, I often practiced my oral English with my girlfriend, and she helped me a lot by correcting my pronunication. 

???question "Do you find it easy to organize your study time?"
    Mostly, I have no difficulty in organize my study time. 
    
    I will work at one thing at a single time, like my programmming projects or my math, physics homework.

    But when the studying task is too hard to focus, I sometimes lose my concentration after a long time study.

???question "Who helps you most in your studies?"
    I recieve most of help from my roommates.

    They are also studying Software Engineering in University, so we can work together to finish homework or project. 

    Also, we specialize in different course or field, so when we work together, I can always learn from them to improve myself.

## Hometown

(Grown up in a big City and like it)

???question "Tell me about your hometown. / Where is your hometown?"
    I was borned in Beijing, just this city. 
    
    It's a very huge, modernized, international city.


???question "Do you like your hometown? / Do you want to move to the countryside in the future?"
    I do like my hometown, Beijing. 

    The life here is utterly convenient, having fast package delivery, lots of restaurants.

    The most importantly, only at the international metropolis[mɪˈtrɒpəlɪs] Beijing, I can get such a broad view of the world.

???question "Do you think your hometown is a good place for children to grow up in?"
    Surely, children can get the best educational resources in Beijing.

    Such as schools, museums, and the cultural atmosphere[ˈætməsˌfɪə].

???question "Did you learn about the history of your home tiwn when you were at school?"
    Of course, Beijing is the capital of many dynasties in ancient China and People's Republic of China.

    So the history of Beijing is taught a lot in middle school.

    By the way, I studied Geography in my middle school, so I even learn the history of Beijing in a geological time scale like 1 billion years ago.

???question "What is your hometown famous for today?"
    The Winter Olympics Game, I guess? 
    
    It's known as the first city that has held both Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics.

## App

???question "What apps have you recently used?"
    I'm not a fan of apps, though I'm learning how to write them at school.

    So I only keep necessary apps on my phone, like wechat where I need to keep in touch with my friends, Jing Dong for online shopping.

???question "Do you have a favourite app?"
    Yes!
    
    I use an app named "Mai Memo", or "墨墨背单词" to prepare the vocabulary for this exam.

    This app is very well-made, with neat user interfaces and wonderful strategies that helps a lot when remembering words.

    I used this app for more than two years.

???question "How do you find out about different apps?"
    I do not find out about new apps that often.

    When I do find out a new app, it is because the app has become very famous.

    However, I don't really download them, because I want to keep my phone clean and I feel enough for what I've got on my phone.

???question "Have you downloaded any new apps recently?"
    Franklly, not.

    Nowadays, news come from everywhere, from wechat, from  weibo, or even from your friend via chat.

    Just spending some time in weibo and wechat, I can heard of almost everything.

    So, there is no need for me to download such a app.

## Colours

???question "What's your favourite colour?"
    My favourite colour is red, the color of fire.

    It makes me really excited when I see it.

    It is not only of fire, also the color of strength, keeping encourage me to work hard in life, to shine light to others.

???question "Did you like the same colours when you were a child?"
    Yes, I also like red when a was a child.

    That kind of things wouldn't change easily.

???question "What colours do your friends like most?"
    A friend of mine also like red, but I guess that is because she is a student from Peking University.

    As for specific reason, I haven't asked why she choose so.

???question "What colour makes you uncomfortable in your room?"
    I would like to decorate my room with warm colour, like wooden furniture and yellow light.

    So colder colores like green and blue don't blend into my room, and them would make me feel not happy and solitary, being separate from the world.
